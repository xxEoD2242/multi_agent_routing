# Multi Agent Routing
A development repository to control multiple drones through the use of a navigation library. This utilizes the [Airsim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) simulation plugin for Unreal Engine and is currently only tested for that environment. More updates will be forthcoming.

## Background
This work came out of research conducted with Professor Shreyas Sundaram of Purdue University. Currently the `Nav` library produces a set of waypoints based upon the input and output coordinates. While not fully tested, this was used to simulate a Lead-Chase scenario for two drones. This project will be updated periodically with updates as we work on different routing protocols.

### The overall objectives of this project will be to:
1. Create a standard routing library to generate routes, similar to ArduPilot.
2. Create a multi-agent routing library to aid researchers in utilizing multiple UAVs.
3. Provide open-source software that is an outgrowth for the SWARM simulator (currently in development).
